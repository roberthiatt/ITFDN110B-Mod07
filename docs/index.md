# Introduction
Hello and welcome to my page where I will review Python concepts such as _pickling_ and _structured error handling_.

# What Is Pickling?
_Pickling_ takes its name from the process of food preservation. The word "pickle" is [Dutch](https://www.etymonline.com/word/pickle#:~:text=pickle%20(n.)%20c.%201400,%20%22spiced%20sauce%20served%20with,which%20are%20of%20uncertain%20origin%20or%20original%20meaning.) and it means "brine," but before I get too carried away with the history of pickling foods, suffice it to say that the concept refers to storing.
