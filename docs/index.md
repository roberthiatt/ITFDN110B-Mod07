# Introduction
Hello and welcome to my page where I will review Python concepts such as _pickling_ and _structured error handling_.

## What Is Pickling?
_Pickling_ takes its name from the process of food preservation. The word "pickle" is [Dutch](https://www.etymonline.com/word/pickle#:~:text=pickle%20(n.)%20c.%201400,%20%22spiced%20sauce%20served%20with,which%20are%20of%20uncertain%20origin%20or%20original%20meaning.) and it means "brine," but before I get too carried away with the history of pickling foods, suffice it to say that the concept refers to storing. 

In [technical terms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pickle-python-object-serialization/), _pickling_ means the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream.

In less technical terms, pickling is a means by which to store, serialize, and refer to data. The concept works similarly to a _dictionary_. Here's an [example](https://pythonbasics.org/pickle/):
